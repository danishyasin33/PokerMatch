This program allows you to input two poker hands through the console app `Match` and determines which one is the winner.

## How to Run

1. Execute `dotnet run --project Match/Match.csproj` in terminal
2. Input your poker hands
3. Get output

## how to run tests

1. Execute `dotnet test PokerTest/PokerTest.csproj`.

## Note

The program has NOT been heavily tested and there may be logical flaws. It'll take more time to test all edge cases and test thoroughly. Time, which I sadly don't have.
